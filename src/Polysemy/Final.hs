    -- | Strategy is a domain-specific language very similar to @Tactics@
    -- (see 'Polysemy.Tactical'), and is used to describe how higher-order
    -- effects are threaded down to the final monad.
    --
    -- Much like @Tactics@, computations can be run and threaded
    -- through the use of 'runS' and 'bindS', and first-order constructors
    -- may use 'pureS'. In addition, 'liftS' may be used to
    -- lift actions of the final monad.
    --
    -- Unlike @Tactics@, the final return value within a 'Strategic'
    -- must be a monadic value of the target monad
    -- with the functorial state wrapped inside of it.
